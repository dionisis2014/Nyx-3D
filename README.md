### Nyx 3D printed quadcopter
Little project I made with the goal to make a cheap and flexible quadcopter.
Bill of materials is very specific but can be changed as needed.
### 3D pritning
Recommended perimeters, top and bottom solid infills are 5 at 0.4mm nozzle width and 0.2mm layer heights.
Sparce infill should be >30% with gyroid of grid pattern.
